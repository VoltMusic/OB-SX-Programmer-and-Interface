# OB-SX-Programmer-and-Interface
This contains the Arduino code and KiCAD project file for creating a OB-SX Programmer and Interface.

The Interface plugs into the D-sub connector at the back of the OB-SX. It accesses the OB-XA's RAM and overwrites data linked to the voice board parameters.
The Programmer allows the user to program each parameter of the voices by sending messages to the Interface over a IC2 bus.



Disclaimer:
By useing the code and PCB design files included in this repository, you take responsibility of any damage that may occur to your OB-SX. I highly recommend useing these materials as a starting point for you to add and improve upon, if you do not have a good understanding of electronics and (Arduino) programming I do not recommend this project. These designs are open source and therefore can be copyed, edited and re-distrubuted as long as it is for non-commercial uses.

Thank you
